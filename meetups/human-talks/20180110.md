# [Human Talk 10/01/2018](https://www.meetup.com/HumanTalks-Paris/events/246478316/)

The meetup is organized every second tuesday of every month in a lot of big cities. This one was in Paris.
You can find the videos of the talks on the [youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKFAwlgWiAB4vUpgnS63qog/)

:heart: is for my favourite talk !

## 5 common misconception about [react native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

* "That's not native, so it should have performance trade off, right?"
* "I don't think we can do [insert a feature here] with react-native"
* "It is a new techno, in one year, it will be abandoned and replaced by something else"
* "Can it be maintained on long run ?"
* "Isn't it super hard to find people that actually can work with react-native ?"

The talker answered to this commonly shared misconceptions about react-native. If you never heard about react-native until
here, I would advice to watch the replay on the youtube channel (when available :smile:)

## E-Learning without internet

Bringing E-Learning courses to student in Ghana who does not have a cheap and stable internet connexion is not an easy task.
They started with a react native application as a POC. They unlocked some more budget so they decided to invest more on
the app. The talker presented how they build a [progressive web application](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) 
that does not need to rely on internet to be used. That's not a new technology, but by combining some of existing features
in browser, we can create application that can work fully offline [see for example](https://www.pokedex.org/) 

A really interesting story. I hope to see more of theses application in the future... In suburb, Internet connexion is
far from stable :worried: 

## Introduction to [atomic design](https://medium.com/@audreyhacq/l-atomic-design-une-m%C3%A9thode-de-co-creation-prometteuse-bd9d5fc2b2ad) :heart:

This talk introduced atomic design. When you are design a web page, you got through a process where you start with
user stories, you create wireframes, you create sketches for each screen and finally you give it to the developer.
The problem with that pipeline is that you design page by page. So you can easily loose consistency between pages.
One way to improve that is designing building blocks : which are called atoms. You combine then to create molecules and 
combine molecules to create pages.
In the end, a developer would be able to create a brand new page using those building block without harassing the UX designer.

Personally, I think this technique would work greatly with [visual TDD](https://toucantoco.com/en/tech-blog/tech/visual-tdd)
and component architecture which is a really trendy approach.

## Microservices architectures

The talks tried to present microservices architectures in 10 (format of the meetup)... After a short introduction about
microservices and how did the architecture popped back in 2014 with Martin Fowler.
It talked about :
* DDD
* Enterprise patterns
* CQRS
* Event sourcing
* Circuit breaker
* ...

Really, every subject needs a talk to be nicely explained, so for me, the talker should have aimed for a subset of the scope 
he tried to introduce...
